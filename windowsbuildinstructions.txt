Install cmake and anaconda

In the anaconda shell:

conda create -n lapis-conda
conda activate lapis-conda
conda install -c conda-forge boost gdal proj geotiff libtiff xtl laz-perf gtest glfw

Add the folder with all the newly-installed DLLs to the PATH environment variable. By default, that's C:\users\yourusername\anaconda3\envs\lapis\library\bin. Not only will this let Lapis find the needed DLLs, this will be enough of a hint for cmake to find the installed packages.

In a fresh cmd prompt, navigate to the folder you cloned Lapis into. Then run:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

If all went well, there should now be a file in the build directory called lapis.sln. This is the solution for lapis. You can open it with visual studio and compile it. Note that the anaconda distribution of lazperf will not work with debug compilations of lapis; if you install with anaconda as suggested above, only release mode compilations will work.
